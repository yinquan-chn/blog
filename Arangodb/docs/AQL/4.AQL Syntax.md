## AQL语法
查询类型，空白，注释，关键字和AQL语言中的名称解释

### 查询类型
一个AQL的查询必须要么返回一个结果（使用RETURN关键字），要么执行一个数据修改操作（使用INSERT，UPDATE，REPLACE，REMOVE或UPSERT关键字）。如果AQL解析器在一个查询中检测到多个数据修改操作，或者它无法确定查询是数据检索还是修改操作，将返回一个错误。

AQL只允许一个查询在单个查询字符串中，因此，不支持像SQL那样使用分号;来分隔多个查询语句是不允许的。

这意味着每次只能执行一个查询操作，如果有多个查询需要执行，您需要对每个查询单独调用执行方法或者在应用层进行逻辑处理。
```js
const db = require('@arangodb').db;

// 单独执行两个查询
let query1Result = db._query('FOR u IN users RETURN u');
let query2Result = db._query('FOR p IN posts RETURN p');
```
而不是像在SQL中那样写成一个字符串：
```sql
-- SQL风格的示例（在AQL中无效）
SELECT * FROM users; SELECT * FROM posts;
```

### 空白
空白（空白，回车，换行，制表符）可以在查询文本中用来增加可读性。Tokens必须用任意数量的空白隔开。在字符串或名称中，如果希望保留空白，必须用引号将其包含在内。

### 注释
注释可以嵌入到查询中的任何位置。AQL解析器将忽略包含在注释中的文本。

多行注释不能嵌套，也就是说，后续注释的开始必须在注释的结束之后，否则将被忽略。

AQL支持两种类型的注释：

单行注释：双斜杠开头，结束于行的末尾或查询字符串的末尾（以先到者为准）

多行注释：这些以斜杠/和星号开始，以星号和斜杠/结束。它们可以跨多行，可以包含任意数量的行。
```AQL
// 单行注释

/* 多行
   注释 */
```

### 关键字
在顶层，AQL提供了以下高级操作：

|操作|描述|
|---|---|
| FOR | 数组迭代 |
| RETURN | 结果返回 |
| FILTER |非视图的结果筛选 |
| SEARCH | 视图的结果筛选 |
| SORT | 结果排序 |
| LIMIT | 结果切片|
| LET | 变量赋值 |
| COLLECT | 结果聚合|
| WINDOW | 聚合相关行 |
| INSERT | 插入新文档 |
| UPDATE | (部分)更新已有的文档 |
| REPLACE | 替换已有的文档 |
| REMOVE | 移除已有的文档 |
| UPSERT | 插入新文档，如果存在则更新 |
| WITH | 集合声明 |

每个操作可以以关键字形式在查询中使用。一个AQL查询通常由多个这些操作组成。

一个AQL查询可能如下所示：
```
FOR u IN users
  FILTER u.type == "newbie" && u.active == true
  RETURN u.name
```
在这个例子中，术语FOR，FILTER和RETURN是根据它们的名字来确定它们的高级操作。这些术语也是关键字，在语言中具有特殊含义。

例如，查询解析器将根据关键字名字来确定它们的高级操作。这意味着关键字只能在特定位置使用，并且所有关键字的单词都作为保留字，不能用在其他地方。

例如，无引号字符串（标识符）的关键字不能用作集合或属性名称。如果你需要在集合或者属性中使用与关键字相同的名称，则需要在查询中对集合或属性名进行引号处理。参见[Names](#names)

Keywords are case-insensitive, meaning they can be specified in lower, upper, or mixed case in queries. In this documentation, all keywords are written in upper case to make them distinguishable from other query parts.

There are a few more keywords in addition to the higher-level operation keywords. Additional keywords may be added in future versions of ArangoDB. The complete list of keywords is currently:

AGGREGATE
ALL
ALL_SHORTEST_PATHS
AND
ANY
ASC
COLLECT
DESC
DISTINCT
FALSE
FILTER
FOR
GRAPH
IN
INBOUND
INSERT
INTO
K_PATHS
K_SHORTEST_PATHS
LET
LIKE
LIMIT
NONE
NOT
NULL
OR
OUTBOUND
REMOVE
REPLACE
RETURN
SHORTEST_PATH
SORT
TRUE
UPDATE
UPSERT
WINDOW
WITH
On top of that, there are a few words used in language constructs which are not reserved keywords. You can use them as collection or attribute names without having to quote them. The query parser can identify them as keyword-like based on the context:

KEEP – COLLECT operation variant
COUNT (WITH COUNT INTO) – COLLECT operation variant
OPTIONS – FOR / Graph Traversal / SEARCH / COLLECT / INSERT / UPDATE / REPLACE / UPSERT / REMOVE operation
PRUNE – Graph Traversal, FOR operation variant
SEARCH – SEARCH operation
TO – Shortest Path / All Shortest Paths / k Shortest Paths / k Paths graph traversal
Last but not least, there are special variables which are available in certain contexts. Unlike keywords, they are case-sensitive:

CURRENT – available in array inline expressions
NEW – available after INSERT / UPDATE / REPLACE / UPSERT operation
OLD – available after UPDATE / REPLACE / UPSERT / REMOVE operation
If you define a variable with the same name in the same scope, then its value will be and remain at what you set it to. Hence you need to avoid these names for your own variables if you want to access the special variable values.

<a id="names"></a>
Names 
In general, names are used to identify the following things in AQL queries:

collections
attributes
variables
functions
Names in AQL are always case-sensitive. The maximum supported length for collection/View names is 256 bytes. Variable names can be longer, but are discouraged.

Keywords should not be used as names. If you want to use a reserved keyword as name anyway, the name must be enclosed in backticks or forward ticks. This is referred to as quoting.

FOR doc IN `filter`
  RETURN doc.`sort`
Due to the backticks, filter and sort are interpreted as names and not as keywords here.

You can also use forward ticks:

FOR f IN ´filter´
  RETURN f.´sort´
Instead of ticks, you may use the bracket notation for the attribute access:

FOR f IN `filter`
  RETURN f["sort"]
sort is a string literal in quote marks in this alternative and does thus not conflict with the reserved keyword.

Quoting with ticks is also required if certain characters such as hyphen minus (-) are contained in a name, namely if they are used for operators in AQL:

LET `my-var` = 42
Collection names 
You can typically use collection names in queries as they are. If a collection happens to have the same name as a keyword, the name must be enclosed in backticks or forward ticks.

Quoting with ticks is also required if special characters such as hyphen minus (-) are contained in a collection name:

FOR doc IN `my-coll`
  RETURN doc
The collection my-coll has a dash in its name, but - is an arithmetic operator for subtraction in AQL. The backticks quote the collection name to refer to the collection correctly.

If you use extended collection and View names (--database.extended-names startup option), they may contain spaces, or non-ASCII characters such as Japanese or Arabic letters, emojis, letters with accentuation, and other UTF-8 characters. Quoting is required in these cases, too:

FOR doc IN ´🥑~колекція =)´
  RETURN doc
The collection name contains characters that are allowed using the extended naming constraints and is quoted with forward ticks.

Note that quoting the name with " or ' is not possible for collections as they cannot be string literals in quote marks.

For information about the naming constraints for collections, see Collection names.

Attribute names 
When referring to attributes of documents from a collection, the fully qualified attribute name must be used. This is because multiple collections with ambiguous attribute names may be used in a query. To avoid any ambiguity, it is not allowed to refer to an unqualified attribute name.

Also see the naming restrictions for Attribute names.

FOR u IN users
  FOR f IN friends
    FILTER u.active == true && f.active == true && u.id == f.userId
    RETURN u.name
In the above example, the attribute names active, name, id, and userId are qualified using the collection names they belong to (u and f respectively).

Variable names 
AQL allows you to assign values to additional variables in a query. All variables that are assigned a value must have a name that is unique within the context of the query.

FOR u IN users
  LET friends = u.friends
  RETURN { "name" : u.name, "friends" : friends }
In the above query, users is a collection name, and both u and friends are variable names. This is because the FOR and LET operations need target variables to store their intermediate results.

Variable names should be different from the names of any collection name used in the same query to avoid shadowing, which can render a collection with the same name inaccessible in the query after the variable assignment:

LET users = []
FOR u IN users // iterates over the "users" variable, not the "users" collection
  RETURN u
Allowed characters in variable names are the letters a to z (both in lower and upper case), the numbers 0 to 9, the underscore (_) symbol and the dollar ($) sign. A variable name must not start with a number. If a variable name starts with one or multiple underscore characters, the underscore(s) must be followed by least one letter (a-z or A-Z). The dollar sign can only be used as the very first character in a variable name and must be followed by a letter.
